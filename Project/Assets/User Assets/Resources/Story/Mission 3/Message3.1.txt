This is message 1 for the first mission. But now I wonder what will happen if I put down a loooot of text in here. Gee, I wonder how this will be handled by the Text UI. Did you know that the color purple is commonly referred to as a regal color? This is because purple was one of the most expensive colors to produce, because it had to be extracted from snails at ridicilously low amounts per snail. Or something like that, I'm not sure about the specifics. Anyways, I hope this is enough text to see what unity will do. I'm pretty sure this is more text than any info message wil have.
